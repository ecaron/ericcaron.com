# Recruiting and People Management

While working at the [Daily](http://www.mndaily.com/), I learned about the challenges of recruiting and interviewing people. At [LinkUp](http://www.linkup.com/) I still dealt with the complexities of hiring/interviewing/managing, but also spent 7 years lamenting with the challenges of being a job seeker. Although I've given talks and [written in books](https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1600052002) about jobseeking, advice to jobseekers is pretty timeless:
* Always keep your resume and [social networks](https://www.linkedin.com/) up to date
* Expect that everything you write online will be read before you go into an interview
* If you see a job posting you like, print it out and keep it in your file - this way you can look back and see patterns in yourself
* Remember that the [vast majority of people find jobs through networking](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking), not through online job searching
* Still search for jobs online, but remember its just like watching the Food Network doesn't fill your stomach - it just helps you understand what you want to eat
