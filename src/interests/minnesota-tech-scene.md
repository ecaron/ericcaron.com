# Minnesota Technology Scene

Just behind family, the #2 reason that I stay in Minnesota is the amazing tech scene (both the people and the companies). I'm not alone in thinking it is amazing, in fact one person made a documentary on the [Minnesota Technology Scene](http://documntary.com/).

Although a large chunk of the greatness comes from the people and the companies, I wanted to take some space to make recommendations about my favorite parts of the community.

## Minnesota Technology News
* [Tech.MN](http://tech.mn/) - I firmly believe that the current wonderful state of the Minnesota community is largely a result of this news resource. Like a TechCrunch dedicated to Minnesota, this company's visibility and involvement in the tech scene brings us all together in critical ways (and when it is -20&deg;, staying connected has to happen online)
* [minnov8 Podcast](http://minnov8.com/) - A weekly podcast, posting since early 2008, offers a great commentary on the community from some people in the know.

## My Favorite Minnesota Technology Communities
*I recognize that all of these are Meetup.com groups, but that's just how we've organized.*
* [JavaScript MN](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptMN/) - "This is a group of Minnesotans getting together to discuss programming JavaScript in the browser, on the server, on mobile devices, and everything in between."
* [Hackers & Founders MN](https://www.meetup.com/h-f-minneapolis/) - "Hackers and Founders is part of a global network of casual meetups focused around bringing together like minded people working on cool things."
* [DevOps Minneapolis](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Minneapolis/) - "This is a group targeted to engineers (both dev and ops), tech professionals, managers, leads, architects and entrepreneurs coming together to learn about and share information on DevOps processes, tools, practices and benefits."
* [NodeMN](https://www.meetup.com/NodeMN/) - "A group for anyone interested in Node.js regardless of skill level or experience."

## My Favorite Minnesota Technology Events
* [MinneDemo](http://minnestar.org/minnedemo/) happens 3 times a year and I've spoken at it twice. 7 geeks each have 7 minutes to give a live demo of their projects. It is fantastic!
* [MinneBar](http://minnestar.org/minnebar/) once a year there's a free all-day technology conference, hosted at Best Buy, where you can learn about everything from 3D-printers to venture funding to new programming languages.
* [Twin Cities Startup Week](http://twincitiesstartupweek.com/) is an action-packed full week that covers the gamut of everything about being a startup in Minnesota.
