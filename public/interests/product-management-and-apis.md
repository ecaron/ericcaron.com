# Product Management and APIs

I'm still not entirely sold on blending these two topics onto the same page. But they're both such niche topics (good for you for reading this, by the way) and I rarely think of one without the other, so for now they're together.

## What is an API?
As I explain it to anyone that doesn't want to get too nerdy, an API is just the term used for two computer programs talk to each other. Like if you post a photo to Instagram and it shows up later on Facebook, it is because Instagram is using Facebook's API.

Like most things in computers, there are lots and lots of opinions on it. I do my best to avoid those holy wars, so you won't see me talking about them here.

## What is the difference between "Product Manager", "Project Manager", and "Program Manager"?
Of the many places online that try to answer this, I'm most fond of [Quora's answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Program-Product-and-Project-manager-roles). Their answer basically breaks down to:
* **<u>Product</u> Manager** is the business owner for a team. They're responsible for making decisions, planning roadmaps, understanding the customer, representing the business, and managing the overall team's well-being.
* **<u>Project</u> Manager** keeps everything moving by scheduling meetings, watching budgets, ensuring vision gets translated into action, and making sure the team has all the necessary building blocks for success.
* **<u>Program Manager</u>** is the less common role, and I think the position is morphing more into a Lead Architect. This is the person that knows the technological capabilities, hears the business requests, and calls out challenges to make the two meet.
