# Coaching & Judging for the Eden Prairie Speech Team

In high school I was a proud member of the Marshall High School Speech Time. I competed in Information, Creative Expression, Dramatic Duo and Extemporaneous Speaking. Our motto was "We do for fun what [most fear more than death](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death)". Extemporaneous Speaking is a fascinating category:
* The contestant draws 3 random topics on national or international affairs (e.g. "What will it take for country X to avoid war with Y?")
* The contestant has 30 minutes to write & memorize a 7 minute speech, including sources to justify their answer
* The contestant gives that 7 minute speech to a judge, being critiqued on content & delivery
* The contestant does that between 3 and 5 times every Saturday from January through April

I firmly believe that high school speech was one of the biggest contributors to successes I've had in business. Being in speech:
* **Helps with interviews** - You learn how to present yourself professionally and confidently
* **Gives you a sense of timing** - Building an internal clock of "That's 10 minutes" is disturbingly useful
* **Teaches how to speak above your pay grade** - Being 16 and talking to a 60 year-old about world issues is a lot like being a new employee talking to a CEO
* **Develops the ability to think on your feet** - Although knowing the right answer to a question is ideal, sometimes in life you just have to [speak with confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness)
* **Hones the skill of being civil to oppponents** - In most competition, there's a strong barrier between you and the other team. In speach you learn from, bond with and befriend the people you're trying to defeat
* **Improves your ability to write, memorize & preset** - Throughout school and your career, you will likely write papers, memorize notes, and present to meetings. Nothing develops this muscle like speech
