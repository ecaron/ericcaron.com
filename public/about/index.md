## My [Short Form] Biography
I grew up in Marshall, MN and did all the typical small town things. I vaguely remember showing the typing teacher how to copy/paste on a black & yellow computer display. At one point my science teacher figured a simpler way to keep me from using the school's dial-up internet was ask me to make him a class webpage. I haven't stopped programming since (and you can see one of my early websites on the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/19980530123639/http://www.starpoint.net/~swtours/)). Working at the fantastic [NetPoint](http://www.starpoint.net) gave me a fantastic crash course in every computer-related aspect a young nerd could dream of.

I went the the University of Minnesota, and although I have a Computer Science degree the majority of my education came from the [Minnesota Daily Newspaper](http://www.mndaily.com/). I learned how to manage projects, budgets, people and serve the customers. I also met some great friends and met my wife there. But I'm not biased. The Daily is incredibly awesome.

From there I worked for a while at a web agency, and learned my heart got too attached to individual companies that it wasn't the path for me. I went to the fantastic [JobDig](http://www.jobdig.com/)/[LinkUp](http://www.linkup.com/) and learned a ton. It was my first introduction to cloud computing, HR technologies, working with offshore labor, and where I really became immersed in the Minnesota technology commuinty. The people at LinkUp were and are amazing, and I'm still a big fan of their work. I also still have a strong passion for the complexity of recruiting - from finding candidates to interviewing to onboarding.

About the time my oldest son was born, I had the opportunity to work with Doug Berg on some startup ideas he wanted to incubate. The one that really took off was TrackIf (now called [MyAlerts](https://myalerts.com/)). I learned a lot about the early-stage VC scene, found the power that comes from an API-centric designed, and met a lot of great people in many different capacities.

Now I'm at Best Buy, and given how much of my childhood money was spent there it was probably inevitable. [I wrote a blog post when I joined](https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/a-best-buy-fanboi-takes-over-the-api-team-4037ba67947c), and I'm continuing to have a great time. In both obvious & unexpected ways, it is both similar and different to the startups that comprise my background. If you'd like to stay abreast of what I'm doing at Best Buy, watching the [Best Buy Developer Blog](https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/) is the best source of information.
