# My Articles & Talks

If you'd like me to talk to your event or conference, please [email me](mailto:eric.caron@gmail.com). I prefer to avoid events in November, since that's a busy time of year. Also I would like two months notice for any events outside of Minnesota, so I can make all the necessary arrangements without stressing the family.
