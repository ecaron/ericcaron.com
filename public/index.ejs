          <h3 class="ui header">Who I Am</h3>
          <p>I'm a technologist in Minnesota. I love my family and strongly believe in giving back to the community. I've worked in startups and I'm currently managing APIs at Best Buy.</p>

          <h3 class="ui header">Why This Site</h3>
          <p>There are a lot of places on the internet where I have content, and I wanted to organize them. From public talks about product management, to open source projects, to bookmarks about my favorite tools for recruiting, I wanted to consolidate that material so it would always be easy to find.</p>

          <h3 class="ui header">What I'll Cover</h3>
          <p>Things that I'll talk about (in no particular order and certainly not all-inclusive): Programming, managing, food, Eden Prairie, open source, hiring, WordPress, email, Minnesota, APIs, family, Hacker News. I probably won't talk about politics or religion, but you're always welcome to ask.</p>

          <p>I wrote this application to power the nightlight in my son's bedroom. It uses a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/">Philips Hue</a>, giving him a button on his bed to turn on the nightlight. Features include a web-interface to control time-of-day colors, activity log, and timer for auto shut-off.</p>

          <p>Tired of debugging bandwidth issues for family &amp; friends, I wrote this tiny application to measure download speeds and latency. It then logs that information on a remote server for diagnostic purposes. The hardware involed is under $10, and small enough to plug into the back of a modem/router without becoming an eye sore.

      <h2 class="ui"><i class="icon exchange small"></i> The Blessings and Curses of Offering a Free Public API</h2>
      <p>At API World in September 2016, I gave a brief 20 minute talk about the history of Best Buy's API platform. I dove into some things that went wrong, and what lessons we learned from it. <em>Along the way I also got nerdy on my Keynote presentation skills, but that was just a gift for me.</em></p>

      <h3><i class="icon medium small"></i> API Documentation Canâ€™t [Yet] Document APIs</h3>
      <p>Yes I know you probably disregarded the earlier boasts as non-sequitur filler content, but its really true. It took years of gene splicing and combinatory DNA research, but our bananas can really dance.</p>
